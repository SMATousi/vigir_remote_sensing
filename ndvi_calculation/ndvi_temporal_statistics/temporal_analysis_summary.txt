Years Analyzed: 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, 2024 (9 years)
Spatial Dimensions: 290 rows x 437 columns

Generated Files:
Basic Statistics:
1. ndvi_median_yield_ranking_*.tif - Median NDVI values for yield ranking
2. ndvi_variability_ranking_*.tif - Variability (95th - 5th percentile)
3. ndvi_standard_deviation_*.tif - Standard deviation across years

Advanced Statistics:
4. ndvi_absolute_normalization_*.tif - Absolute normalization across all years
5. ndvi_temporal_trend_slope_*.tif - Temporal trend slope (change per year)
6. ndvi_temporal_trend_r2_*.tif - R-squared values for temporal trends
7. ndvi_management_zones_*.tif - Management zone classifications

Management Zone Classifications:
0 = Invalid/NoData (pixels with insufficient data)
1 = Stable High (high median performance)
2 = Stable Low (low median performance)
3 = Variable (high standard deviation)
4 = Declining Trend (significant negative slope)
5 = Increasing Trend (significant positive slope)

Management Recommendations by Zone:
- Stable High: Management is working well, maintain practices
- Stable Low: Address soil fertility, drainage, or other limiting factors
- Variable: Consider variable rate applications or field experiments
- Declining: Investigate consistent problems, may need intervention
- Increasing: Identify successful practices for other field areas

Notes:
- NoData value: -999 (0 for management zones)
- NDVI values should be in normalized range
- Absolute normalization shows relative performance across entire field
- Trend analysis requires minimum 3 years of data per pixel
- Zone classification uses percentile-based thresholds
